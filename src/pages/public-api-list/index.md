Today, I developed an app that uses <a href='#'>@toddmotto</a>'s valuable API list. Good thing is he provided us with a JSON dump of all available API records just in case we would like to use it for our own purposes.

You can check the app <a href='http://jolly-almeida-3abd38.netlify.com/'>here</a>. It was built using **react** and **semantic ui**.

Any kind of contributions are welcome!
